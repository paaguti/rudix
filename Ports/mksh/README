mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
own) are available.
